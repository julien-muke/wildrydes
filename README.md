## AWS Project - Build a Full End-to-End Web Application with 7 Services

Build a ride sharing app (for unicorns!), pulling from the AWS Wild Rydes sample project.  I used seven different AWS  services: CodeCommit, Amplify, Cognito, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB. 

## AWS Project Overview

WILDRYDES is basically an Uber oryt except for unicorns, with some good static content, incorporate user registration and and log in and be able to be able to work with some map functionality, so that if we were in Seattle let's say we could request a unicorn just by clicking on the map we'll request unicorn.

It's really a great app for tying together a bunch of different services in AWS and you'll actually have a working application when you're done that you could share with friends or family.
